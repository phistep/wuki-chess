|wuki|: a Toy Chess Engine
==========================

|wuki| is a chess engine I wrote to practize my Python and explore different
programming problems.
Chess is a fun opportunity to implement a library and also look into writing
an artificial intelligence.

.. TODO crossref

This project comes with a library implementing the game, commandline and
graphical interfaces to interact with the library, and an AI to play against.
